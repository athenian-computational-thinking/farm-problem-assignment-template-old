# The Farm Problem

In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species: chickens = 2 legs, cows = 4 legs, pigs = 4 legs. The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

## Problem Description
Calculate the number of animal legs are on the farm. The function takes the following parameters: chickens, cows and pigs.

* Write your code in the function.
* Use the print statements to test your code.
* Run pytest as a final check
* Submit (remember: Stage, commit (with message) and then push)

## Example
```
Chickens: 2
Cows: 2
Pigs: 2
Total legs: 10
```

## Hints
* Use `input()` to prompt the farmer for numbers of animals. 

Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.

Run your code with: Run Python File in Terminal or use green arrow in upper right corner

Run your tests with: `pytest`
